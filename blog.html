                        know what you're able to afford to narrow down your apartment rental search. Start 
                        by determining your ideal rental budget. It should be easy for you to manage (not too expensive) 
                        in case your financial circumstances change and should leave room for any additional charges like
                         internet, heat and hydro.</h5>

                    Are you considering moving cities as well as properties? If you don't need to move 
                    to a particular place (for work or personal reasons), do your research before moving
                     to a new-to-you destination. Start by researching the average rental cost in your desired 
                     destination. If it fits your budget, find out if the Canadian city you're moving to has a
                      good cost of living and quality of life rating.

                        because it impacts their lifestyle and commute heavily. Love to go out at night? A downtown location might
                         be best. Need a safe and quiet area close to schools for your kids? The suburbs may suit you best. Want to
                          walk more than drive or commute by transit? Look for neighbourhoods in close proximity to your school or
                           work, grocery stores, shops and entertainment venues.</h5>
